This lesson will really suck you in. I'm teaching you about the vortex next.
You can shoot a special bullet that turns into a mini black hole.
Shoot some vortexes through the gaps in those boxes. 
Then, pop'em early so that you catch the target dummies and the arrows all in the vortex together.
Use Right Click or the Right Bumper to shoot/activate a Vortex.
