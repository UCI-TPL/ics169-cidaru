This lesson will really suck you in. You're learning about the vortex next.
You can shoot a special bullet that turns into a mini black hole.
It'll pop when you activate it again or when it hits something. 
It can suck in objects, projectiles, and even small enemies. 
I've enlisted some help for this next one. 
Use it on that trojan to temporarily disable the turret it's operating.
Use Right Click or the Right Bumper to shoot/activate a Vortex.
