Alright Gundalf, this is a Time Portal. Keep an eye out for them, it's how we Wizards travel.
To get you ready for your fight with the Normies, you need some real battle experience. 
And what better place to get that than Ancient Troy! Be careful, the Trojans have been a little agitated over some recent kidnapping incidents.
Step through this portal to get going, and good luck. I'll let you know the next step of the plan once you find the next Time Portal.
