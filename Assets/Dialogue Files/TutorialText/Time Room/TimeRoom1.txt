Okay Gundalf, it's time to learn to control time. You can either speed things up or slow things down.
Using Time Slow, you can slow down the time in an area.
You can also speed yourself up to quickly Dash in the direction you're moving.
Use these abilities to get through these turrets. Make sure not to get hit though, or you gotta start over.
Use E or the B button to deploy a Time Slow Field.\nUse Left Shift or Left Trigger to Dash.
